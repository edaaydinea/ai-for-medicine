# AI for Medicine
This repository includes  all projects of the AI for Medicine Specialization offered by deepleearning.ai and taught by Pranav Rajpurkar.  

This program will give me practical experience in applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques to concrete problems in modern medicine:

- **In Course 1**, I created convolutional neural network image classification and segmentation models to make diagnoses of lung and brain disorders. 
- **In Course 2**, I built risk models and survival estimators for heart disease using statistical methods and a random forest predictor to determine patient prognosis. 
- **In Course 3**, I built a treatment effect predictor, apply model interpretation techniques and use natural language processing to extract information from radiology reports.
